              paired sequences with the massive scale of unpaired antibody
              sequence datasets. However, given the novelty of this strategy,
              the field lacks a systematic evaluation of data processing methods

              training data while accommodating the significant imbalance in the
              size of existing paired and unpaired datasets. Here, we introduce
              a method of curriculum learning for AbLMs, which facilitates a
              gradual transition from unpaired to paired sequences during
              training. We optimize this method and compare it to other data
              sampling strategies for AbLMs, including a constant mix and a
              fine-tuning approach. We observe that the curriculum and constant
              approaches show improved performance compared to the fine-tuning
              approach in large-scale models, likely due to their ability to
              prevent catastrophic forgetting and slow overfitting. Finally, we
              show that a 650M-parameter curriculum model, CurrAb, outperforms
              existing mixed AbLMs in downstream residue prediction and

              primarily compute-constrained. In contrast, antibody language
              models (AbLMs) trained on paired sequences are primarily

              how model size and data scale affect AbLM performance, we trained

              three training data sizes. From these experiments, we derive an

              650M-parameter ESM-2 protein language model would require ∼5.5

               glycoprotein (Env) serves a central role in viral fusion with the
               host cell. As such, the FP is highly conserved and therefore an
               attractive epitope for vaccine design. Here, we describe a
               vaccination study in non-human primates (NHPs) where glycan
               deletions were made on soluble HIV Env to increase FP epitope

               our earlier work identifying sarbecovirus receptor-binding domain

               residue prediction accuracy in the highly variable CDR3.
               Preferential masking also improves antibody classification by

              the only known target of neutralizing antibodies, but its inherent
              metastability and conformational flexibility have hindered the
              development of GPC-based vaccines. We employed a variant of
              AlphaFold2 (AF2), called subsampled AF2, to generate diverse
              structures of LASV GPC that capture an array of potential
              conformational states using MSA subsampling and dropout layers.
              Conformational ensembles identified several metamorphic
              domains-areas of significant conformational flexibility-that could
              be targeted to stabilize the GPC in its immunogenic prefusion
              state. ProteinMPNN was then used to redesign GPC sequences to
              minimize the mobility of metamorphic domains. These redesigned
              sequences were further filtered using subsampled AF2, leading to
              the identification of promising GPC variants for further testing.
              A small library of redesigned GPC sequences was experimentally

               individuals typically after at least 2-3 years of chronic

               suggesting that highly conserved neutralizing epitopes on the
               HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein are difficult for B cell receptors to
               effectively target, during natural infection. Recent studies have
               shown the evolution of bnAbs in HIV-1 infected infants. Methods:
               We used bulk BCR sequencing (BCR-seq) to profile the B cell
               receptors from longitudinal samples (3 time points) collected
               from a rare pair of antiretroviralnaïve, HIV-1 infected pediatric
               monozygotic twins (AIIMS\_329 and AIIMS\_330) who displayed elite
               plasma neutralizing activity against HIV-1. Results: BCR-seq of
               both twins revealed convergent antibody characteristics including
               V-gene use, CDRH3 lengths and somatic hypermutation (SHM).
               Further, antibody clonotypes with genetic features similar to
               highly potent bnAbs isolated from adults showed ongoing
               development in donor AIIMS\_330 but not in AIIMS\_329,
               corroborating our earlier findings based on plasma bnAbs
               responses. An increase in SHM was observed in sequences of the
               IgA isotype from AIIMS\_330. Discussion: This study suggests that
               children living with chronic HIV-1 can develop clonotypes of
               HIV-1 bnAbs against multiple envelope epitopes similar to those
               isolated from adults, highlighting that such B cells could be
               steered to elicit bnAbs responses through vaccines aimed to
               induce bnAbs against HIV-1 in a broad range of people including

              several human V2-apex bnAb-precursors and stimulated an
              appropriate response in V2-apex bnAb precursor-expressing knock-in
              mice. Here, we tested the immunogenicity of three MT145 variants
              (MT145, MT145K, MT145K.dV5) expressed as chimeric
              simian-chimpanzee-immunodeficiency-viruses-(SCIVs) in rhesus
              macaques-(RMs). All three viruses established productive
              infections with high setpoint vRNA titers. RMs infected with the
              germline-targeting SCIV\_MT145K and SCIV\_MT145K.dV5 exhibited
              larger and more clonally expanded B cell lineages featuring long

              Although none of the animals developed bnAbs, these results show

               result in publicly available antibody sequence datasets that
               contain many duplicate or highly similar sequences. Available
               datasets are further skewed by the predominance of studies
               focused on specific disease states, primarily cancer,
               autoimmunity, and a small number of infectious diseases that
               includes HIV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. These biases and
               redundancies are a barrier to rapid similarity searches and
               reduce the efficiency with which these datasets can be used to
               train statistical or machine-learning models. Identity-based
               clustering provides a solution; however, the extremely large size
               of available antibody sequence datasets makes such clustering
               operations computationally intensive and potentially out of reach
               for many scientists and researchers who would benefit from such
               data. Results: Antibody Reference Clusters (AntiRef), which is
               modeled after UniRef, provides clustered datasets of filtered
               human antibody sequences. Due to the modular nature of recombined
               antibody genes, the clustering thresholds used by UniRef for
               general protein sequences are suboptimal for antibody clustering.
               Starting with an input dataset of ∼451M full-length, productive
               human antibody sequences, AntiRef provides reference datasets
               clustered at a range of antibody-optimized identity thresholds.
               AntiRef90 is one-third the size of the input dataset and less
               than half the size of the non-redundant AntiRef100. Availability
               and implementation: AntiRef datasets are available on Zenodo
               (zenodo.org/record/7474336). All code used to generate AntiRef is

               (SARS-CoV-2) underscores the need for strategies to rapidly
               develop neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that can function as
               prophylactic and therapeutic agents and to help guide vaccine
               design. Here, we demonstrate that engineering approaches can be
               used to refocus an existing antibody that neutralizes one virus
               but not a related virus. Through a rapid affinity maturation
               strategy, we engineered CR3022, a SARS-CoV-1-neutralizing
               antibody, to bind to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2
               with >1000-fold increased affinity. The engineered CR3022
               neutralized SARS-CoV-2 and provided prophylactic protection from
               viral challenge in a small animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
               Deep sequencing throughout the engineering process paired with
               crystallographic analysis of engineered CR3022 elucidated the
               molecular mechanisms by which the antibody can accommodate
               sequence differences in the epitopes between SARS-CoV-1 and
               SARS-CoV-2. This workflow provides a blueprint for the rapid
               broadening of neutralization of an antibody from one virus to
               closely related but resistant viruses.",

              antibodies (bnAbs) from naïve precursors are hindered by unusual
              features that characterize these Abs, including insertions and
              deletions (indels). Longitudinal studies of natural HIV infection
              cases shed light on the complex processes underlying bnAb
              development and have suggested a role for superinfection as a
              potential enhancer of neutralization breadth. Here we describe the
              development of a potent bnAb lineage that was elicited by two
              founder viruses to inform vaccine design. The V3-glycan targeting
              bnAb lineage (PC39-1) was isolated from subtype C-infected IAVI
              Protocol C elite neutralizer, donor PC39, and is defined by the
              presence of multiple independent insertions in CDRH1 that range
              from 1-11 amino acids in length. Memory B cell members of this
              lineage are predominantly atypical in phenotype yet also span the
              class-switched and antibody-secreting cell compartments.
              Development of neutralization breadth occurred concomitantly with
              extensive recombination between founder viruses before each virus
              separated into two distinct population ``arms'' that evolved
              independently to escape the PC39-1 lineage. Ab crystal structures
              show an extended CDRH1 that can help stabilize the CDRH3. Overall,
              these findings suggest that early exposure of the humoral system
              to multiple related Env molecules could promote the induction of

               publicly available antibody sequence datasets containing many
               duplicate or highly similar sequences. These redundant sequences
               are a barrier to rapid similarity searches and reduce the
               efficiency with which these datasets can be used to train
               statistical or machine learning models of human antibodies.
               Identity-based clustering provides a solution, however, the
               extremely large size of available antibody repertoire datasets
               make such clustering operations computationally intensive and
               potentially out of reach for many scientists and researchers who
               would benefit from such data. Results: AntiRef (Antibody
               Reference Clusters), which is modeled after UniRef, provides
               clustered datasets of filtered human antibody sequences. Starting
               from a dataset of ~335M unique, full-length, productive human
               antibody sequences from the Observed Antibody Space repository,
               several AntiRef cluster sets were generated. Due to the modular
               nature of recombined antibody genes, the clustering thresholds
               used by UniRef (100, 90 and 50 percent identity) to cluster
               general protein sequences are suboptimal for antibody clustering.
               AntiRef provides reference antibody sequence datasets clustered
               at a range of relevant identity thresholds: 100, 99, 98, 96, 94,
               92 and 90 percent. AntiRef90, which uses the lowest clustering
               threshold of any AntiRef dataset, is roughly one-third the size
               of the filtered input dataset and less than half the size of the
               non-redundant AntiRef100. Datasets: AntiRef comprises a series of
               datasets, each representing one of several clustering thresholds.
               AntiRef datasets were generated by a nested clustering procedure
               similar to UniRef which, proceeding in order of decreasing
               stringency, clusters the representative sequences from the
               preceding round of clustering. AntiRef datasets can be found at

               desirable to generate vaccines capable of eliciting broadly
               neutralizing antibody responses to CoVs. Here, we show that
               immunization of macaques with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein with a
               two-shot protocol generated potent serum receptor binding domain
               cross-neutralizing antibody responses to both SARS-CoV-2 and
               SARS-CoV-1. Furthermore, responses were equally effective against
               most SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) and some were highly
               effective against Omicron. This result contrasts with human
               infection or many two-shot vaccination protocols where responses
               were typically more SARS-CoV-2 specific and where VOCs were less
               well neutralized. Structural studies showed that cloned macaque
               neutralizing antibodies, particularly using a given heavy chain
               germline gene, recognized a relatively conserved region proximal
               to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor binding site
               (RBS), whereas many frequently elicited human neutralizing
               antibodies targeted more variable epitopes overlapping the RBS. B
               cell repertoire differences between humans and macaques appeared
               to influence the vaccine response. The macaque neutralizing
               antibodies identified a pan-SARS-related virus epitope region

               been limited by our understanding of the immune response to

               in-depth analysis using systems biology approaches, but to be

               blood and tissue sampling. Methods that support this intensive
               sampling need to be developed and validated as feasible. To this

               study of 15 healthy adults, who were immunized with hepatitis B
               vaccine. Sampling included ~350 mL of blood, 12 microbiome

              Accordingly, we report here the isolation of 45 BG505 autologous

               average frequency of gene mishits, 0.02 mishit frequency and
               IgBLAST the lowest, 0.004 mishit frequency. Reproducibility in
               the output of complementarity determining three regions (CDR3
               amino acids) ranged from 4.3\% to 77.6\% with preprocessed data.
               In addition, run time of the tools was assessed: MiXCR was the
               fastest tool for number of sequences processed per unit of time.
               These results indicate that immunoinformatic analyses greatly
               depend on the choice of bioinformatics tool. Our results support

               chain antibody repertoires of a model animal, the OmniRat, by
               high throughput antibody sequencing and made use of two novel
               datasets for comparison to human repertoires. Intra-animal and
               inter-animal repertoire comparisons reveal a high level of
               conservation in antibody diversity between the lymph node and
               spleen and between members of the species. Multiple differences
               were found in both the heavy and kappa chain repertoires between

               naive antibody repertoire in humans is estimated to be at least
               1012 unique antibodies2. Because the number of peripheral blood B
               cells in a healthy adult human is on the order of 5 × 109, the
               circulating B cell population samples only a small fraction of
               this diversity. Full-scale analyses of human antibody repertoires
               have been prohibitively difficult, primarily owing to their

               variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes. The modified

               we investigated the involvement of glycan recognition in the
               development of the CAP256.VRC26 Ab lineage. We found that sialic

              complementarity-determining regions, and some are polyreactive,
              casting doubt on whether bnAbs to HIV can be reliably induced by

              epitopes that induce broadly neutralizing Abs are difficult to

              oligomerization, conformational flexibility, sequence diversity
              and extensive glycosylation of Env protein. To enhance for
              isolation of quaternary epitope-targeting Abs (QtAbs), we
              previously used HIV virus-like particles (VLPs) to bind B cells
              from long-term non-progressor subjects to identify a panel of
              monoclonal Abs. When expressed as recombinant full-length Abs, a
              subset of these novel Abs exhibited the binding profiles of QtAbs,
              as they either failed to bind to monomeric Env protein or showed
              much higher affinity for Env trimers and VLPs. These QtAbs
              represented a significant proportion of the B-cell response
              identified with VLPs. The Ab genes of these clones were highly
              mutated, but they did not neutralize common HIV strains. We sought
              to further define the epitopes targeted by these QtAbs.
              Competition-binding and mapping studies revealed these Abs
              targeted four separate epitopes; they also failed to compete for
              binding by Abs to known major neutralizing epitopes. Detailed
              epitope mapping studies revealed that two of the four epitopes
              were located in the gp41 subunit of Env. These QtAbs bound
              pre-fusion forms of antigen and showed differential binding
              kinetics depending on whether oligomers were produced as
              recombinant gp140 trimers or as full-length Env incorporated into
              VLPs. Antigenic regions within gp41 present unexpectedly diverse
              structural epitopes, including these QtAb epitopes, which may be

               and two were neutralizing. In addition, we found 14 naturally
               occurring HCDR3 sequences that acquired the ability to bind to
               the HIV-1 gp120 monomer when adding 2- to 7-amino acid mutations
               via computational design. Of those 14 designed Abs, 8 neutralized
               HIV-1, with IC50values ranging from 0.7 to 98 µg/mL. These data

               rare B cells that encode HCDR3 loops that bind or neutralize
               HIV-1 when presented on a PG9 background with relatively few or
               no additional mutations. Long HCDR3 sequences are present in the

              Critical unmet challenges are to determine whether bnAb precursor

               mucosal tissues harbor unique repertoires. We examined the

               human tissues using RNA samples derived from a large number of

               and strongly suppress SHIV viremia in established infection in
               macaque models. However, these antibodies demonstrate varying
               degrees of dependency on the N332 glycan site, and the origins of
               their neutralization breadth are not always obvious. By measuring
               neutralization on an extended range of glycan site viral
               variants, we found that some bnmAbs can use alternate N-linked
               glycans in the absence of the N332 glycan site and therefore
               neutralize a substantial number of viruses lacking the site.
               Furthermore, many of the antibodies can neutralize viruses in
               which the N332 glycan site is shifted to the 334 position.
               Finally, we found that a combination of three antibody families

               neutralization coverage of a large panel of viruses containing

              somatically mutated, raising doubts as to whether they can be
              elicited by vaccination. We used 454 sequencing and designed a
              novel phylogenetic method to model lineage evolution of the bnAbs
              PGT121-134 and found a positive correlation between the level of
              somatic hypermutation (SHM) and the development of neutralization
              breadth and potency. Strikingly, putative intermediates were
              characterized that show approximately half the mutation level of
              PGT121-134 but were still capable of neutralizing roughly 40-80\%
              of PGT121-134 sensitive viruses in a 74-virus panel at median
              titers between 15- and 3-fold higher than PGT121-134. Such
              antibodies with lower levels of SHM may be more amenable to
              elicitation through vaccination while still providing noteworthy
              coverage. Binding characterization indicated a preference of
              inferred intermediates for native Env binding over monomeric
              gp120, suggesting that the PGT121-134 lineage may have been
              selected for binding to native Env at some point during

              comprise the epitope and suggests changes in glycan dependency or
              recognition over the course of affinity maturation for this
              lineage. Finally, patterns of neutralization of inferred bnAb

              specificity for a particular epitope typically increase as
              antibody genes acquire somatic mutations in antigen-stimulated B
              cells. In this work, we investigated whether germline gene-encoded
              antibodies are optimal for polyspecificity by determining the
              basis for recognition of diverse antigens by antibodies encoded by
              three VH gene segments. Panels of somatically mutated antibodies
              encoded by a common VH gene, but each binding to a different
              antigen, were computationally redesigned to predict antibodies
              that could engage multiple antigens at once. The Rosetta
              multi-state design process predicted antibody sequences for the
              entire heavy chain variable region, including framework, CDR1, and
              CDR2 mutations. The predicted sequences matched the germline gene
              sequences to a remarkable degree, revealing by computational
              design the residues that are predicted to enable polyspecificity,
              i.e., binding of many unrelated antigens with a common sequence.
              The process thereby reverses antibody maturation in silico. In
              contrast, when designing antibodies to bind a single antigen, a
              sequence similar to that of the mature antibody sequence was
              returned, mimicking natural antibody maturation in silico. We
              demonstrated that the Rosetta computational design algorithm
              captures important aspects of antibody/antigen recognition. While
              the hypervariable region CDR3 often mediates much of the
              specificity of mature antibodies, we identified key positions in
              the VH gene encoding CDR1, CDR2, and the immunoglobulin framework
              that are critical contributors for polyspecificity in germline
              antibodies. Computational design of antibodies capable of binding
              multiple antigens may allow the rational design of antibodies that
              retain polyspecificity for diverse epitope binding.",

               Two broad potently neutralizing HIV-specific antibodies, PG9 and

               HCDR3s results from selection of unusual clones from the naïve
               repertoire rather than through accumulation of insertions. These
               antibodies typically use a small subset of D and J gene segments
               that are particularly suited to encoding long HCDR3s, resulting
               in the incorporation of highly conserved genetic elements in the
               majority of antibody sequences encoding long HCDR3s.",

              mAbs that recognized the Sa antigenic site on the head of
              influenza hemagglutinin and exhibited inhibitory activity against
              a broad panel of H1N1 strains. All five Abs used the V(H)3-7 and
              J(H)6 gene segments, but at least four independent clones were
              identified by junctional analysis. High-throughput sequence
              analysis of circulating B cells revealed that each of the
              independent clones were members of complex phylogenetic lineages
              that had diversified widely using a pattern of progressive
              diversification through somatic mutation. Unexpectedly, B cells
              encoding multiple diverging lineages of these clones, including
              many containing very few mutations in the Ab genes, persisted in
              the circulation. Conversely, we noted frequent instances of amino
              acid sequence convergence in the Ag combining sites exhibited by
              members of independent clones, suggesting a strong selection for
              optimal binding sites. We suggest that maintenance in circulation
              of a wide diversity of somatic variants of dominant clones may
              facilitate recognition of drift variant virus epitopes that occur
              in rapidly mutating virus Ags, such as influenza hemagglutinin. In
              fact, these Ab clones recognize an epitope that acquired three
              glycosylation sites mediating escape from previously isolated
              human Abs.",

              neutralizing antibodies or to protect against infection.
              Neutralizing antibodies against HIV bind to native functionally
              active Env trimers on the virion surface. Gag-Env pseudovirions
              recapitulate the native trimer and could serve as an effective
              epitope presentation platform for study of the neutralizing
              antibody response in HIV-infected individuals. To address if
              pseudovirions can recapitulate native HIV virion epitope
              structures, we carefully characterized these particles,
              concentrating on the antigenic structure of the coreceptor binding
              site. By blue native gel shift assays, Gag-Env pseudovirions were
              shown to contain native trimers that were competent for binding to
              neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent
              assay, pseudovirions exhibited increased binding of known
              CD4-induced antibodies after addition of CD4. Using flow
              cytometric analysis, fluorescently labeled pseudovirions
              specifically identified a subset of antigen-specific B cells in
              HIV-infected subjects. Interestingly, the sequence of one of these
              novel human antibodies, identified during cloning of single
              HIV-specific B cells and designated 2C6, exhibited homology to mAb
              47e, a known anti-CD4-induced coreceptor binding site antibody.
              The secreted monoclonal antibody 2C6 did not bind monomeric gp120,
              but specifically bound envelope on pseudovirions. A recombinant
              form of the antibody 2C6 acted as a CD4-induced epitope-specific
              antibody in neutralization assays, yet did not bind monomeric
              gp120. These findings imply specificity against a quaternary
              epitope presented on the pseudovirion envelope spike. These data
              demonstrate that Gag-Env pseudovirions recapitulate CD4 and
              coreceptor binding pocket antigenic structures and can facilitate
              identification of B-cell clones that secrete neutralizing
              antibodies.",
