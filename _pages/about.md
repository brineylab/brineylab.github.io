We generate massive datasets of human antibody sequences and use them to train state-of-the-art models of structure, function and evolution. 
Our group works at the interface between experimental and computational immunology, which ideally
positions us to iterate rapidly through successive ***train–test–learn*** cycles, a process that requires seamless
transitions from the bench to the GPU (and back). The models and methods we create can be used to
evaluate antibody responses to candidate vaccines, engineer monoclonal antibodies to improve a variety of properties 
(affinity, expression, developability, etc.), and fully *de novo* discovery of antigen-specific antibodies directly from sequence.
